<h1>Mapping the Justinianic Plague: 541-600 </h1>
<p> The Plague of Justinian or Justinianic Plague (541â€“549 AD) was the beginning of the first plague pandemic, the first Old World pandemic of plague, the contagious disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. The disease afflicted the entire Mediterranean Basin, Europe, and the Near East, severely affecting the Sasanian Empire and the Roman Empire and especially its capital, Constantinople.

  <h3>The site contains a few sections:</h3>
   <ul>
<li>
Section <a href="webpages/maps.php">Mapping the Plague </a> includes three maps showing five plague waves from 541 to 600.
The circles are coloured according to a year of an outbreak. Each map is supplied by a relevant spreadsheet with information on an outbreak and my comments.
</li>
<li>
Section <a href="webpages/trade.php">Commercial Networks </a> includes a map showing key products of regions and the tight connections between regions. Since the Plague was supposedly spread
by maritime trade, these connections are relevant for understanding the Justinianic Plague. 
</li>

<li>
Section <a href="webpages/harbours.php"> Harbours </a> includes a map of all known Ancient and Medieval 
ports and harbours provided by Harvard University Databases. The map on load is empty. You will need 
to type in a number of harbours you want to see.  
</li>

<li>
Section <a href="webpages/conclusions.html"> Conclusions </a> includes a ready set of all the maps, shown in the previous sections, provided as images for comparison.
</li>
<li> 
Section <a href="webpages/biblio.html"> Bibliography </a> includes a full list of sources used for the research.
